# 💵 Image Recognition Model
## Project Overview  
In this project, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify various types of currency. The model was built using the `tensorflow` library with the built-in `tf.keras` API. This is a simplified version of a deep learning model and comes with limitations, including a relatively small dataset (~100 images per class), which leads to overfitting and reduced generalization performance.

### Tools
- Jupyter.notebook - train/test and build the model
- VSC - to test the model on local server
