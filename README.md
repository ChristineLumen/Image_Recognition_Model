# 💵 Image Recognition Model
## Project Overview  
In this project, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify various types of currency. The model was built using the `tensorflow` library with the built-in `tf.keras` API. This is a simplified version of a deep learning model and comes with limitations, including a relatively small dataset (~100 images per class), which leads to overfitting and reduced generalization performance.

### Data Source
The dataset used for model training was created by the author. It consists of 5 currency types(5 classes), each of one has ~100 images for model training, ~10 images for model testing and validation.   

### Tools
* Jupyter Notebook
   * used to train, test, and build the model
* _Visual Studio Code (VSC)_ – used to test the model on a local server
